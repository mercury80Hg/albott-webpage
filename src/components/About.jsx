					Wind in the rigging, a cobra in the rafters, an elephant roars to the

					For 20 years Allan was a restaurateur managing eateries in many bustling
					corners of the u.s.a. During that time he enjoyed making friends with
					people from all walks of life, honing his personal and professional
					skills.

					However, it is only when you reach the top of a precipice that you can
					then more easily see you are surrounded by peaks. Having reached a
					plateau in hospitality with a solid set of skills Allan decided to
					search for a mountain with no peak. Software became that endless goal of
					constant learning where one can master something only for it to be
					deprecated shortly after. Technology is ever-changing and feeding off
					new faster programming and New is not every year but every day. The
					endless landscape of software, where the jack-of-all gets farther ahead.
