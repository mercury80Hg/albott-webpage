                <p className="content-paragraph" > Really? Did nothing cancel? Michael! Really? Did nothing cancel? It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life.
                    I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch.
                    I care deeply for nature. No… but I'd like to be asked! We just call it a sausage. Marry me. I'm a monster.
                    Marry me. I'm afraid I just blue myself. No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide. No… but I'd like to be asked!
                    Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. Not tricks, Michael, illusions. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right.
                    Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. Whoa, this guy's straight?</p>

                    I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
